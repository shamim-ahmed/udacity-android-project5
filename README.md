##Make Your App Material Project Rubric

#Overview

This rubric is here to help you understand the expectations for how your project will be evaluated. It is the same rubric that the person evaluating your project will use. You  should look at the rubric before you begin working on this project and before you submit it.
How Grading Works

Your project evaluator will be able to see all of your code submissions. They will use this rubric to evaluate your code as well as your written responses.
Your grade will simply be "meets specifications," “exceeds specifications,” or "doesn’t meet specifications,"
You earn “meets specifications” if all criteria in the Required Components section “meet specifications”.
Your project “doesn’t meet specifications” if any criteria in the Required Components section are graded as “does not meet specifications.” In this case, you will have the opportunity to revise and resubmit your work.
The Rubric

To “meet specifications”, your app must fulfill all of the criteria listed in this section of the rubric.
